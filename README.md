# Smart-Home-Automation
This project showcases a basic smart home automation system designed to control household appliances automatically and remotely. Using a microcontroller along with sensors and wireless modules, common devices like lights, fans, and switches can be operated through a smartphone or voice commands.
The system continuously monitors the environment and makes decisions based on sensor readings. For example, lights can turn on when someone enters a room, appliances can switch off automatically to save power, and users can manually control everything through a mobile app or a simple web dashboard. The goal is to make everyday home management more convenient, energy-efficient, and secure.

This prototype demonstrates how modern homes can integrate automation to improve comfort, reduce electricity consumption, and provide users with full control over their surroundings from anywhere.
